        At first, the symbols look confusing, like a secret language waiting to be understood. 
        One line becomes two, then ten, and suddenly the screen responds. 
        Errors appear, not as failures, but as clues pointing toward better solutions.

        In the soft glow of the monitor, coding becomes more than instructions for a machine—it becomes a way to shape ideas into reality.`;
