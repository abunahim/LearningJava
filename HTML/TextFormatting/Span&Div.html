            The old elevator always paused on the 7th floor, even though no one lived there.
            Every morning, Maya felt the same chill as the doors slid open to an empty hallway—lights flickering, carpet untouched by footsteps.
            One day, a note lay on the floor.
            “Thank you for stopping.”
            <span style="background-color: lightblue">Her heart raced. She hadn’t told anyone about the elevator.
            The next morning, she skipped the button for 7.
            The elevator stopped anyway.
            This time, the hallway was warm. And someone was smiling, like they’d been waiting a very long time.</span>
