                Every morning, the lighthouse keeper wrote letters to the sea. 
                He described the weather, his dreams, the way gulls argued like old men. 
                He sealed each note in a bottle and watched waves carry them away. 
                Years passed. One stormy night, a knock came. 
                A woman stood dripping, holding a sack of bottles. 
                Inside were his letters, dry and neatly stacked. 
                “The sea can’t read,” she said, smiling. “But I can.” 
                They talked until dawn, and the lighthouse finally learned why it had been lit. 
                Together they listened as waves applauded softly, forgiving loneliness, promising return, and beginning life together.
