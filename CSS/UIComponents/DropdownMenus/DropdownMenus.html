        <p>Every morning, the fruit stand argued.
        The apples bragged about being chosen first.
        The bananas claimed they were the most comforting.
        The oranges laughed, bursting with energy no one could ignore.
        One day, a tired kid stopped, unsure.
        Instead of shouting, the fruits fell quiet.
        The kid picked one of each.
        That night, for the first time in weeks, dinner felt balanced—and so did life.</p>
