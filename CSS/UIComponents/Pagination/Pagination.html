        <h1>The Elevator That Skipped</h1>

        <p>The elevator was supposed to stop at floor 12.
        Instead, it went to 12½.
        The doors opened to a hallway that smelled like rain and old paper.
        A sign read: “For people who almost chose differently.”
        When the doors began to close, Alex had to decide—
        step out, or go back to the life that still felt unfinished.</p>
