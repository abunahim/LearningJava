        <h1>The Last Bus</h1>

        <p>The last bus of the night stopped for no one—except tonight.
        Mara ran, waving, already knowing she was too late.
        The doors opened anyway.
        The driver smiled and said, “You finally decided to come back.”
        Mara froze.
        She’d never been on this route before.</p>
