        <p id="p1">The cat arrived without warning, sitting neatly on the windowsill during a thunderstorm. It was soaking wet, unimpressed, and clearly disappointed in the weather.
        Mara opened the window. The cat walked in like it owned the place.
        Every night after that, it left at exactly 3 a.m. Every morning, something small was different—a fixed lamp, a watered plant, a note she didn’t remember writing.
        One night, Mara followed the cat.
        By morning, the apartment felt emptier. Perfectly tidy. Peaceful.
        The windowsill stayed dry, even in the rain.</p>
